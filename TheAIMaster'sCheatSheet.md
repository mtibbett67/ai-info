## 🚀 **The AI Master’s Cheat Sheet**
Here is a concise, high-impact "cheat sheet" of the frameworks from the video. You can copy this into a digital note or print it to keep near your desk for quick reference.

### **1. The Prompt Builder (AIM)**

*Use this for every initial request to avoid vague results.*

* **A - Actor:** "You are a [World-class Expert/Specific Role]..."
* **I - Input:** "Here is the [Context/Data/File/Draft]..."
* **M - Mission:** "Your goal is to [Specific Output]..."

### **2. The Context Builder (MAP)**

*Use this to give the AI "grounding" so it doesn't hallucinate.*

* **M - Memory:** "Based on our previous discussion about..."
* **A - Assets:** "Referencing the attached PDF/data..."
* **A - Actions:** "Search, write, or create something..."
* **P - Prompt:** The specific instruction using **AIM**.

### **3. The Debugger (Verification Patterns)**

*Use these when the AI gives you a weak or generic answer.*

* **Chain of Thought:** "Think step-by-step and show your reasoning before the final answer."
* **Verifier:** "Ask me 3 clarifying questions one at a time before you start."
* **Refinement:** "Propose 2 sharper versions of my prompt and ask which I prefer."

### **4. The Fact-Checker (Audit)**

*Use this to ensure the AI isn't confidently lying.*

* **Assumptions:** "List your assumptions and rank them by confidence."
* **Sources:** "Cite two independent sources with URLs and quotes."
* **Counter-Evidence:** "Find one credible source that disagrees with this."
* **Audit:** "Slow down, re-compute the figures, and show your math."

### **5. The "Human Taste" Filter (OCEAN)**

*Use this to make the output sound original and high-value.*

* **O - Original:** "Give me 3 angles no one else has thought of."
* **C - Concrete:** "Use real names, numbers, and specific examples."
* **E - Evident:** "Show your logic in bullets before the answer."
* **A - Assertive:** "Pick a side and defend it; don't be neutral."
* **N - Narrative:** "Write this as a story (Hook → Problem → Insight)."
